        <h2>STUB PAGE FOR VETRAULICH (Discord-Valorant interface)</h2>
        <p>
            Vetraulich is a dynamic interface between the Valorant API and discord<br>
            servers. It is intended for easy use for players to gather statistics<br>
            about their games and their friends as well as providing support for managing<br>
            custom matches and recording their results.<br><br>
            I also plan on adding extensive gameplay analysis features and potential tools<br>
            for managing small/community tournaments (play-by-plays, overlay information, etc.)<br>
